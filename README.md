# Spotify End-to-End Data Engineering project
### This project focuses on designing and implementing an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for music data using the Spotify API and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The pipeline aims to retrieve, transform, and load music data from Spotify into a s3 bucket on AWS, enabling further analysis and insights. By leveraging the Spotify API's rich music metadata and AWS services' scalability and reliability, this project demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach for managing and analyzing music data.
